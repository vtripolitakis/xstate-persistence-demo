# XState Demo with API and SQLite Persistence

This project is a demonstration of using XState (version 5.x) with a simple order transaction system that persists data to SQLite. It includes an Express server for handling HTTP requests, where each order is managed by its own XState state machine actor. The state of each order is persisted to a SQLite database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vtripolitakis/xstate-persistence-demo.git
   cd xstate-persistence-demo

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

This will run npm install to install all dependencies and initialize the SQLite database using the provided initdb script.

## Usage
Start the server:

```bash
make start
```
The server will be running on http://localhost:3000.

To stop the server:

```bash
make stop
```
